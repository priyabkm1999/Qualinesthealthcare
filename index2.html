                A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized
                medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of hospital
                is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent
                health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. 
                A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, 
                with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care.

            <h1>Our Team</h1>
            <p>The healthcare team, regardless of whether you’re treated at a large academic institution 
            or a small, rural private practice, is the group of professionals who contribute to your care
            and treatment as a patient. Typical members of a healthcare team are a doctor and a registered 
            nurse. In some cases, there might be a Nurse Practitioner instead of or as well as a doctor.
            In others, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and social workers may be part of the 
            team. Office managers also play an important role in the healthcare team.</p>
